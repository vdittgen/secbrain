"""Question pattern detection for the learning loop.

Classifies raw user questions into reusable intent patterns
(e.g. "schedule_today", "health_check") via keyword scoring.
Orthogonal to ``QueryTracker.classify_question_domain()`` which
classifies by domain (calendar, health, etc.) — patterns classify
by *what the user wants to know*.
