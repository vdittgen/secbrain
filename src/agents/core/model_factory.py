"""Build pydantic-ai ``Model`` instances from user settings.

Routes:

- **local** — Ollama on the user's machine, fronted by its
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint. The only route used in SecBrain.
- **remote** — A reserved extension-point route. Falls through to
  local here.

The factory is lazy: pydantic-ai imports are deferred until first call
